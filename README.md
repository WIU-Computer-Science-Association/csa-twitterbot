# csa-twitterbot
A WIP CSA twitterbot in Java using Twitter4J.

The goal of this bot is to listen to the CSA github and emails to tweet out when something is updated or events are posted through email.

Twitter4J and JSoup are used in this project, that might change though (specifically with JSoup if we don't need it). 

This is based off of a twitterbot I have made before for tweeting events and random jokes. Some of the code reflects that, and that's one of the things that might need worked on is to make the code more lean. I've tried to keep a good documentation through the code but it might not be perfect either.

Anyone is welcome to suggest changes and work on the code to make it better.
